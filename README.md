# Python
A basic tutorial in python to get started with Data Science.
I have used a raw code-based approach to explain the basic concepts of Data Science using Python.
This code is open source and free to use.
I highly recommend that you first read the notebook and then implement it by yourself.
You can always reach out to me on kshitiz.github@gmail.com for any problems faced.
