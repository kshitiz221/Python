# Python - Data Science
* A basic tutorial in python to get started with Data Science.<br>
* I have used a raw code-based approach to explain the basic concepts of Data Science using Python.<br>
* This code is open source and free to use.<br>
* I highly recommend that you first read the notebook and then implement it by yourself.<br>
* You can always reach out to me on kshitiz.github@gmail.com for any problems faced.
