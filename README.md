# Python - NumPy
* A basic tutorial in python to get started with Data Science using NumPy library.
* I have used a raw code-based approach to explain the basic concepts of Data Science using Python.
* This code is open source and free to use.
* I highly recommend that you first read the notebook and then implement it by yourself.
* You can always reach out to me on kshitiz.github@gmail.com for any problems faced.

# Numerical Python (NumPy)
* NumPy is the most essential and scientific library in Python Programming language. 
* It provides support for lagre multi-dimensional array objects and various tools to work with them.
* Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn are some of the libraries that are built with NumPy as a base.


## NOTE
Knowledge of BASIC Python concepts is highly recommended.
